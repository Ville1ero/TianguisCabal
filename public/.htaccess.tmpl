#Basic Rewrite Rules, taken From Zend Framework
#http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Configuring%2BYour%2BURL%2BRewriter
RewriteEngine on

#In your local config you might need to reconfig this, by example lets say that
#your local public dir is viewable by: http://localhost/repositories/tiaguiscabal/public
#then your rewrite base would be: /repositories/tianguiscabal/public
#in a server where "public" is visible directly in http://domain/, leave this as '/'
#Used in conjunction with web_root in config.ini
RewriteBase /

#These rules exclude real files and directories from the rewriting and lets them
#pass through unaffected:(uncomment IF NEEDED).
#RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
#RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

#Extend this list as you need more files to be directly accesible trought Apache
